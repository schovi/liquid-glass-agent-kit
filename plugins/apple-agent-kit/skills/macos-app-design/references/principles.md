# Behavioral principles — what makes a Mac app feel like a Mac app

These principles are framework-agnostic. They apply equally to SwiftUI, AppKit, an Electron app striving for native feel, or a web mockup simulating macOS chrome. Internalize them before writing any view code.

Distilled from working Mac apps (Linear, Raycast, Things, Arc, Fantastical, Bear, Tot) and Apple HIG.

## Core philosophy

A native app is **not a destination**. It is a **system tool** that lives where the user needs it. Design every interaction around this principle: appear when needed, get out of the way immediately after.

A Mac user has many apps open at once. They expect smooth transitions between active and inactive states. They expect the menu bar, keyboard, drag-and-drop, and Spotlight to work without surprise.

## Pre-flight checklist

Before writing any view code:

1. **Layout** — top bar for global actions, sidebar for navigation (skip if nav is minimal), center for content. Inspector on the right when contextual detail beats modality.
2. **Traffic lights** — integrate into the UI (top bar or sidebar). Never floating awkwardly over content.
3. **Window drag zone** — top ~50pt must be draggable. Keep it uncluttered.
4. **Empty states** — show them. Progressive disclosure: only reveal UI when it's useful.
5. **Keyboard shortcuts** — every primary action needs one. Every shortcut needs visual feedback when triggered (don't fire silently).
6. **Light + Dark mode** — design both. Do NOT invert colors. See `light-dark-and-accessibility.md`.
7. **Search** — always prominent and accessible. Consider a floating search field or a Cmd-K palette.
8. **Drag and drop** — content **in** AND **out** of the app. This is non-negotiable for native feel. If your content has any persistence, it has a drag representation.
9. **Micro-animations** — every state change gets a transition. No interaction without feedback. But honor `reduceMotion`.
10. **Onboarding** — brief, modal-based, teaches shortcuts **through doing** (not reading). Five clicks, not five paragraphs.

## Behavioral rules

### Progressive disclosure

Don't show UI until it's useful. Toolbar items that only apply to selection appear when there's a selection. Inspector panels reveal on demand. The view starts quiet and reveals depth as the user engages.

### Action discovery

Every action exists in at least two places:

1. The menu bar (always — the user looks here first).
2. A visible UI affordance (button, toolbar item, sidebar control) **or** a keyboard shortcut.

If only the menu bar has it, the user finds it slowly. If only the UI has it, the keyboard-driven user can't reach it. If only the keyboard has it, nobody discovers it. Two surfaces minimum.

### Drag and drop, both directions

Drag content **in** AND **out**. Both. Test:

- Can I drag a file from Finder onto the app? Does the app do the right thing?
- Can I drag content **out** of the app to Finder, Mail, Notes, another app?
- Does the drag preview look right at the cursor?

This is the single biggest "feels like Mac" signal. Web apps fail it. Don't.

### Keyboard parity

Anything mouse-clickable should be keyboard-reachable. Anything keyboard-driven should have a visible affordance for discovery. Custom hit areas need explicit focus rings — the system doesn't draw them on your behalf.

### Onboarding teaches through doing

The worst onboarding: a five-screen modal of text. The best: a guided sequence where the user clicks once per step and the app teaches a shortcut as it happens. ("Press ⌘N to create your first note.")

Skip-able. Re-enterable from Help. Never blocking.

### Settings are sparse

A native Mac app doesn't have 40 settings. It has the 5 the user actually needs and good defaults for the rest. Settings open from App → Settings (⌘,). Never reach for Settings to fix a UX problem; redesign the default.

### Window is not the app

The user closes a window. The app keeps running. Reopen from Dock, ⌘N, or clicking the Dock icon. Quit only on ⌘Q. Don't fight this — `applicationShouldTerminateAfterLastWindowClosed` returns `false` for utility-class apps; `true` for single-window-document apps. Pick deliberately.

### Respect the system

- System accent color — read it, don't override.
- System font — `-apple-system` family or `Font.system`. Don't ship Helvetica.
- Sound effects — almost never. The user has chosen silence.
- Auto-hide menu bar — works in full-screen automatically. Don't fight it.

## What "native feel" actually is

The user can't articulate it but can sense it instantly:

- Spring animations feel like the system's, not custom curves.
- Window resize is smooth, content reflows without flicker.
- Right-click on anything that selects gives a contextual menu.
- ⌘-clicking opens in a new window/tab where appropriate.
- ⌥-modifier reveals power options without dedicated UI.
- The menu bar is alive — items enable/disable to match state.
- Fonts hint correctly at every size.
- The cursor changes shape over interactive regions.

None of this is about Liquid Glass. None of it is about visuals. It's about behavior matching expectation.
