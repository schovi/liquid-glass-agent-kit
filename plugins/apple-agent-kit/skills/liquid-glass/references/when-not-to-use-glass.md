# When not to use glass (native)

Mirrors `spec/rules/when-not-to-use-glass.md`. Glass is a
navigation-layer material. Putting it behind content makes content
harder to read, and on macOS 26 / iOS 26 it can outright fail to
render.

The forbidden-surface IDs (F1–F5) are documentary surface rules. The
audit IDs (A1, A2) are the patterns the auditor agent flags.

## F1 — Page background

A window-spanning glass surface samples the desktop wallpaper, turns
every other floating glass element into glass-on-glass automatically,
and costs the GPU a full-screen sampling pass for what reads as a
flat tint.

- failure: `.glassEffect()` on the root container, an
  `NSGlassEffectView` sized to the window.
- fix: keep the window background solid. Apply glass to the chrome on
  top (toolbar, sidebar via `NSSplitViewItem.behavior = .sidebar`,
  popover, menu).

## F2 — Long-form text containers

Body text on a sampled backdrop shimmers under scroll. Contrast drops
below WCAG AA on busy backdrops — documented on iOS 26 Lock Screen
(NN/g) and Control Center (Infinum). The system reduced-transparency
fallback is the escape hatch; if you need it, you used glass in the
wrong place.

- failure: `Text(article).background(.glass(...))`,
  `ScrollView { Text(body) }.glassEffect()`.
- fix: place body text on solid content surfaces. Chrome around the
  reading surface may be glass (Mail / Notes pattern).

## F3 — Forms and input fields

Inputs stack their own surfaces — system autocomplete, validation,
suggestion bars. Any of them landing on a glass-backed field becomes
glass-on-glass (F5).

- failure: `.glassEffect` behind a `TextField` / `SecureField` /
  `NSTextField`.
- fix: inputs stay solid. If the panel around them is glass, the
  input is a solid pill on the panel. `spec/components/text-field.yaml`
  enforces `glass: forbidden`.

## F4 — Dense data tables

Tables put a contrast battle on every row before glass enters the
mix. Sampled backdrop noise destroys row boundaries where the eye
most needs an anchor.

- failure: `NSTableView` or SwiftUI `Table` with `.glassEffect()` on
  the enclosing surface.
- fix: tables are content. Render on a solid surface. Toolbar /
  inspector around the table may be glass.

## F5 — Glass-on-glass

Two glass surfaces stacked. The upper surface samples a backdrop that
is itself sampled — no real refraction, the specular line tracks
nothing meaningful. On macOS 26 / iOS 26 the inner element can fail
to render: JuniperPhoton documented a regression in iOS 26.1 where a
`Menu` inside a `GlassEffectContainer` drops its glass entirely, and
each `CABackdropLayer` costs three offscreen textures.

- failure: nested `.glassEffect`, nested `NSGlassEffectView`, glass
  popover anchored to a glass toolbar item without separating
  spacers.
- fix: group siblings with `GlassEffectContainer` (SwiftUI) /
  `NSGlassEffectContainerView` (AppKit). The container shares one
  sampling pass. For cross-distance grouping use
  `.glassEffectUnion(id:in:)`.

## Adoption context

Apple shipped Liquid Glass to a mixed reception. NN/g published a
usability takedown; Apple's removal of the
`UIDesignRequiresCompatibility` opt-out in Xcode 27 is being treated
by some developers as a forced upgrade. The kit's position: ship
Liquid Glass on the floating layer where it works, and follow the
rules above on the content layer where it doesn't.
